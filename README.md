# Generative Ai: Prompt Engineering Basics 


# Task 1. Prompt-Instructions-and-the-Prompt


Difference Between Prompt Instructions and Prompt

Prompt Instructions are like rules for how the AI should talk to me. The Prompt is the actual question I ask the AI.

I could put the Prompt Instructions right before my question, but it looks nicer and cleaner if I keep them separate.

Neatness: Splitting them makes everything look tidy.

Consistency: The instructions apply to the whole chat without repeating.

Flexibility: If I want the instructions to apply to only one question, putting them right before the question works better.

Explanation
Prompt Instructions are rules for how the AI should talk. Here, I want the AI to be happy and excited.
Prompt is the question I ask. I want to know about five important people in computer science and their work.

# Task 2. Experimenting with Prompts

Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained on vast amounts of data to generate novel content, including text, images, and video. 

To generate the desired response, you should feed the input to a model as a prompt. It is important to provide a context-based, clear, and precise prompt to guide the model and get the desired output. The process of designing effective prompts to generate better and desired responses is called prompt engineering.

In this lab, I will learn the basics of prompt engineering and experiment with simple prompts to control how a model interprets and generates desired and coherent responses.

Learning Objectives
Design a prompt structure to write concise prompts based on requirements.
Write unambiguous and context-based prompts to generate the desired output.
Write prompts in different formats, such as questions, statements, and instructions.
Let's get started prompting and experimenting with foundation models.

Before You Start Prompting
Before beginning the exercise, I must set up the AI classroom and know the generative AI workspace.

Step 1: Set Up the AI Classroom
Name the Chat: Give the chat a specific name for better organization.
Choose the Foundation Model: Select the appropriate model for the task.

Step 2: Know Your Workspace
Use Prompt Instructions: Provide clear instructions to guide the AI.
Type Your Message: Enter the prompt in the input area.
Manage Your Chat: Keep track of the conversation history.
Delete the Chat from History: Remove unnecessary chat logs to keep the workspace clean.

Step 3: Identify the Task
Before drafting a prompt, I should clearly understand the task that the model needs to perform. 
For example, do I want the model to generate a story or a social post, or do I want the model to summarize text or classify text by identifying sentiments?

Step 4: Select the Model
Before designing prompts, it is important to understand the model I will leverage to accomplish the tasks. In this exercise, I will use the foundation model gpt-3.5-turbo to experiment with the prompts.

OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo is an advanced foundation large language model. 
As a powerful tool for generating coherent and contextually relevant text, the gpt-3.5-turbo foundation model can be used for various applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, content generation, and more. It can be applied for translating languages, answering questions in an informative way, and completing tasks such as writing poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, emails, letters, and so on.
